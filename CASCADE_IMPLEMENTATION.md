CASCADE SEGMENTATION MODEL - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
====================================================

Project: Breast Cancer AI - Two-Stage Cascade Segmentation
Date: October 15, 2025

ARCHITECTURE DETAILS
====================

Stage 1: Tissue Segmentation Model
-----------------------------------
Input: Full mammogram image (1 channel, 512x512)
Output: 4-class segmentation map (4 channels, 512x512)
  - Class 0: Background
  - Class 1: Adipose tissue (pixel value 64)
  - Class 2: Fibroglandular tissue/FGT (pixel values 128/192) ← KEY REGION
  - Class 3: Pectoral muscle (pixel value 255)

Architecture Components:
- ResNet34 encoder (pretrained on ImageNet)
- ASPP (Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling) at bottleneck
  * Multi-scale context with dilation rates: 1, 6, 12, 18
- ACA (Adaptive Context Aggregation) decoder
  * Channel Attention: learns important feature channels
  * Spatial Attention: learns important spatial locations
  * Feature Fusion: combines refined features
- 4 upsampling stages with skip connections

Loss Function: 
- 0.5 × Multi-class Dice Loss + 0.5 × Cross-Entropy Loss

Training:
- Optimizer: AdamW (lr=1e-3, weight_decay=1e-4)
- Scheduler: CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts (T_0=10, T_mult=2)
- Epochs: 50
- Batch size: 8
- Image size: 512×512
- Augmentation: Flip, Rotate, Brightness/Contrast, GaussNoise

Expected Performance:
- FGT Dice Score: 0.85-0.92
- Overall accuracy: 0.88-0.94

Stage 2: Cancer Segmentation Model
-----------------------------------
Input: Cropped FGT region from Stage 1 (1 channel, 384x384)
Output: Binary cancer segmentation (1 channel, 384x384)

Architecture Components:
- ResNet34 encoder (pretrained on ImageNet)
- ASPP at bottleneck
- ACA decoder with skip connections
- Same architecture as Stage 1, but:
  * 1 output channel (binary segmentation)
  * Smaller input size (384×384) for focused detection

Loss Function:
- Dice-BCE Loss (Dice coefficient + Binary Cross-Entropy)

Training:
- Optimizer: AdamW (lr=1e-3, weight_decay=1e-4)
- Scheduler: CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts (T_0=15, T_mult=2)
- Epochs: 100
- Batch size: 12
- Image size: 384×384
- Augmentation: Flip, Rotate, Brightness/Contrast, ElasticTransform

Expected Performance:
- Cancer Dice Score: 0.75-0.85
- Sensitivity: 0.80-0.90
- Specificity: 0.85-0.92

Cascade Integration
-------------------
The CascadeSegmentationModel combines both stages:

1. Input image → Stage 1 → Tissue segmentation (4 classes)
2. Extract FGT region (class 2) with bounding box + padding
3. Crop and resize FGT region to 384×384
4. FGT region → Stage 2 → Cancer segmentation (binary)
5. Output: Both tissue types AND cancer locations

Advantages:
✓ Focused detection on relevant tissue (FGT)
✓ Reduced false positives from irrelevant regions
✓ Mimics radiologist workflow
✓ Better feature learning per stage
✓ Can train stages independently

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

Issue: CUDA out of memory
Solution: Reduce batch size (--batch-size-stage1 4 --batch-size-stage2 6)
          or image size (--img-size-stage1 384 --img-size-stage2 256)

Issue: Stage 1 low accuracy
Solution: Check mask values (should be 64, 128, 192, 255)
          Run analyze_segmentation_data.py to verify
          Increase epochs (--epochs-stage1 75)

Issue: Stage 2 not detecting cancer
Solution: Verify Stage 1 is well-trained first
          Check cancer dataset quality
          Try lower learning rate (--lr-stage2 5e-4)
          Increase epochs (--epochs-stage2 150)

Issue: Training too slow
Solution: Use smaller batch size but more epochs
          Use mixed precision training (requires code modification)
          Reduce image sizes

Issue: Model not converging
Solution: Lower learning rate by 2-5x
          Check data quality and labels
          Reduce augmentation strength
          Use learning rate warmup

7. Clinical decision support features
8. Export to ONNX/TensorRT for production deployment
9. Web interface for easy usage
10. Multi-GPU training support

VALIDATION STRATEGY
===================

Recommended evaluation:

4. Compare with radiologist annotations
5. Measure clinical metrics:
   - Sensitivity (recall)
   - Specificity
   - PPV (precision)
